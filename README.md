**Wireshark-Protocol-Analysis**

**Project Description**
This project demonstrates the use of Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic. The focus is on identifying different network protocols such as DNS, ICMP, TCP, HTTP, TLS/SSL, and ARP. The project helps in understanding how these protocols appear in network traffic and how to inspect them using Wireshark.
<br>

Steps Performed <br>
Installed Wireshark. <br>
Captured live traffic on the active network interface. <br>
Generated traffic by visiting websites and performing ping operations.
Stopped the capture after sufficient traffic was recorded.
Applied filters to isolate different protocols.
Identified at least three different protocols from the captured traffic.
Exported the captured packets as a .pcap file.


<br>
**Protocols Observed**
DNS - Domain name resolution
ICMP - Ping and connectivity testing
TCP - Reliable data transfer
HTTP - Web traffic (unencrypted)
TLS/SSL - Encrypted web traffic (HTTPS)
ARP - MAC address resolution on the local network
<br>
**Tools Used** <br>
Wireshark

Output
.pcap file containing the captured traffic

Summary report of identified protocols
