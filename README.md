**Wireshark-Protocol-Analysis**
<br>

Project Description:
This project demonstrates the use of Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic. The focus is on identifying different network protocols such as DNS, ICMP, TCP, HTTP, TLS/SSL, and ARP. The project helps in understanding how these protocols appear in network traffic and how to inspect them using Wireshark.
<br>

Steps Performed: <br>
Installed Wireshark. 
<br>
Captured live traffic on the active network interface. 
<br>
Generated traffic by visiting websites and performing ping operations. 
<br>
Stopped the capture after sufficient traffic was recorded. 
<br>
Applied filters to isolate different protocols. 
<br>
Identified at least three different protocols from the captured traffic. 
<br>
Exported the captured packets as a .pcap file. 
<br>


<br>
Protocols Observed
<br>
DNS - Domain name resolution
<br>
ICMP - Ping and connectivity testing
<br>
TCP - Reliable data transfer
<br>
HTTP - Web traffic (unencrypted)
<br>
TLS/SSL - Encrypted web traffic (HTTPS)
<br>
ARP - MAC address resolution on the local network
